Pong Game using Python and Turtle

Pong is one of the most famous arcade games, simulating table tennis.  Each player controls a paddle in the game by dragging it vertically across the screenâ€™s left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball.

Turtle is an inbuilt graphic module in Python. It uses a panel and pen to depict illustrations.
